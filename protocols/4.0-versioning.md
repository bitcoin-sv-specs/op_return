# Versioning in OP_RETURN

Protocols can implement versioning by chaining based upon a private key per version that is issued in an OP_RETURN.

## Proposal

A new, optional, data element `<version-key>` is provided. This is public key derived from a private key known to the publisher of the OP_RETURN.

A second data element `<prior-version-key>` is required when issuing a transaction that increments the version number of the OP_RETURN. This key matches the previous transaction's `<version-key>` and the new OP_RETURN also provides its own `<version-key>`. This new `<version-key>` is derived from the private key for the prior version's OP_RETURN, and can be verified as a valid version increment by an explorer or protocol interpretation engine.
