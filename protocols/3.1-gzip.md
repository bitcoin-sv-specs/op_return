# GZIP protocol identifier

Protocol identifier: `0x677a6970`

GZIP is a transformation protocol intended to encapsulate another protocol.

## Specification

The protocol identfier is a `PUSHDATA` data element `0x04 0x677a6970` which is the 1 byte length prefix followed by the 4 byte identifier which translates to the ASCII string `gzip`.

The `gzip` protocol identifier is intended to transform another `OP_RETURN` based protocol by adding two simple rules:

If the `gzip` identifier is present and only one `PUSHDATA` element follows, that element contains gzipped data.  It should be ungzipped then the array of bytes should be parsed for `PUSHDATA` elements then treated as another protocol with the first element being a protocol identier.

If the `gzip` identifier is present and more than one `PUSHDATA` element follows then it should be assumed that each data element is prefixed with a single byte flag indicating whether the following data element is gzipped.  `OP_0` (`0x00`) indicates it is not, `OP_1` (`0x01`) indicates that it is.  The `gzip` handler should decompress any compressed elements and strip out the flag elements.  Returning a decompressed series of `PUSHDATA` elements.  This sequence should then be interpreted as a protocol indicated by the first of these data elements as a protocol identifier.

This protocol is stream friendly and can be implemented as a pipeline of stream handlers: `gzip_handler -> sub_handler`

### Examples 

##### Gzip a single data element: 

`'gzip' <file_protocol_gz>`

Which should be returned from the gzip handler as:

`'file' <filename> <data>`

Which is then passed to the `file` protocol handler.

##### Compressed FILE data but uncompressed FILEAME:

`'gzip' 0 'file' 0 <filename> 1 <data_gz>`

This should be passed to the gzip handler which should output:

`'file' <filename> <data>`

Which is then passed to the `file` protocol handler.

##### Compressed FILE and FILENAME:

`'gzip' 0 'file' 1 <filename_gz> 1 <data_gz>`

This should be passed to the gzip handler which should output:

`'file' <filename> <data>`

Which is then passed to the `file` protocol handler.

##### Compressed DATA but uncompressed TYPE:

`'gzip' 0 'data' 0 <type> 1 <data_gz>`

This should be passed to the gzip handler which should output:

`'data' <type> <data>`

Which is then passed to the `data` protocol handler.
